It is currently 2:41am, and I am finishing up the last of LiquidProust's 2023 Ao Fu Hou.

This was the first tea from LiquidProust I had a particularly strong memory of. I thought it was really interesting. Drinking this now, part of it was because Ao Fu Hou is an interesting cultivar, another part of it is because LiquidProust has a very distinct house oolong taste.

I randomly came across this bag with 5g left after a particularly bad dancong session, and wanted to redeem my night. It tastes... alright. The leaf reminded me of a particularly cringe etsy review I left of this tea that praised the quality of the leaf. In reality this is probably the lowest quality dancong leaf I've seen, with clear huangpian and stems mixed in. 

This is, however, definitely a redemption and saved me from the previous bad session slump. The slightly sweet, slightly grapefruit note with not a lot of fragrance, not a lot of complexity, but also not a lot of things to hate. 

When I opened the bag, I didn't think there would be only 5g left. If I did knew I probably would have never opened the bag. I hate finishing up teas, especially if it's impossible to get any more of them, like in this case.

But now that I've opened it, and drank what is one of the few remainders of how I stumbled around in the past, I'm quite glad. This is quite a comforting brew for 3am. Both for the body and for the mind.
